# How it works:

Python runs numerous simulations for each possible move and finds which one has the best average result. To get a better AI you can increase the number of simulations
that it runs on line 242 of the python file. With enough simulations it can get 2048 pretty easily, but you will be waiting for a while. As the javascript for displaying the 
game was built more as a proof of concept than a clean execution of how to build a game in web development, sometimes things can appear a bit glitchy.
